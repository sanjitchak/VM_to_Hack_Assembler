This is a project for the Nand2tetris part -2 course in Coursera. (Course Link - https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2 )

Here, I built a VM code (like Java Bytecode) to Hack assembler (like a binary file) for their hack computer using java.

It converts their VM code to their assembly code.

Code is bit messy but it works.

Translator is to be run in command line.
